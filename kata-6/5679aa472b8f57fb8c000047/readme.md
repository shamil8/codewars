# Equal Sides Of An Array

<p>You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<p>Let's say you are given the array <code>{1,2,3,4,3,2,1}</code>:<br>Your function will return the index <code>3</code>, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index (<code>{1,2,3}</code>) and the sum of the right side of the index (<code>{3,2,1}</code>) both equal <code>6</code>.</p>
<p>Let's look at another one.<br>You are given the array <code>{1,100,50,-51,1,1}</code>:<br>Your function will return the index <code>1</code>, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index (<code>{1}</code>) and the sum of the right side of the index (<code>{50,-51,1,1}</code>) both equal <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Last one:<br>You are given the array <code>{20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}</code><br>At index 0 the left side is <code>{}</code><br>The right side is <code>{10,-80,10,10,15,35}</code><br>They both are equal to <code>0</code> when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)<br>Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.  </p>
<p>Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong><br>An integer array of length <code>0 &lt; arr &lt; 1000</code>. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong><br>The lowest index <code>N</code> where the side to the left of <code>N</code> is equal to the side to the right of <code>N</code>. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.  </p>
